        <p>Creating a Plan</p>
      </div>

      <div id="content1">
          <p>I offer site visits to appraise your current garden and offer any advice you may wish for on the plants and layout that you have already. I will also provide you with my simple questionnaire that should help you to decide what it is you want your garden to be and be used for.
              Sometimes people find that this is all they need, and carry on with their own garden development with no further input from me.</p>
        </div>

      <div id="content2">
          <p>I can measure your garden and create an accurate scale drawing, showing all of the key features as they exist currently. This is the base plan upon which I would create a new design.
              For some, this base plan is all they want as it gives them the basics on which they can sketch their own designs – and have great fun doing it!</p>

          Making your New Garden
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="content3">
          <p>My approach is to consider all of requirements as identified using my unique questionnaire, and to create a design and planting scheme that accommodates these. The design will also reflect the budget you have set, and your views on how much time you wish to spend gardening in the future.
              I hand-draw and colour every design myself, and it’s yours to keep whether you decide to actually realise the design or not.
              The design will incorporate any hard landscaping features you have requested, as well as a full, illustrated list of all the plants proposed.
              </p>
        </div>

      <div id="content4">
          <p>Clearing and preparing the site- it will probably be necessary to remove at least some trees, shrubs, plants and hard landscaping features from your existing garden, and to dig over and improve the soil prior to re-planting.
              You can do this yourself of course (though it can be a lot of hard work!) or get a gardening contractor to do this for you. I am happy to oversee this stage for you if you wish by a series of site visits and meetings with the contractor, or you can manage the contractor yourself.
              Building work– any hard landscaping elements you have asked for as part of your new design will require a competent builder (unless you are one yourself!). Again, I am happy to oversee this stage for you if you wish by a series of site visits and meetings with the contractor, or you can manage this element yourself too.
              Sourcing the plants– I use a number of excellent wholesale suppliers to source plants for the gardens I design, and will happily manage this for you. I charge a commission on the plant costs, but even including this I will usually be able to source plants at well below normal garden centre prices. You can of course choose to source your own plants if you prefer.
              Planting out– Although you could do this part yourself, I recommend that you involve me in this work as the long-term success of any plant relies heavily on correct planting. This said I encourage people to get their hands dirty and help out with the planting – it makes the end result feel much more your own creation, it’s very satisfying, and it will save you money.

       Aftercare
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="content5">
        <p>I will happily make an after-care visit once the new planting has been in place for a few weeks to check all is well and answer any questions you may have.
            The ongoing success of your new garden will rely on your care, and I can advise you on what each plant needs to achieve its full potential. Depending on the size of your garden and the amount of time you yourself wish to spend on it, you may wish to engage a gardener to help you. I will happily recommend local gardeners if you wish.
            If any plant fails due to a health problem it had before planting but which manifests itself only later, I will of course happily replace it free of chare.
            After that I am always available by email and will happily advise you ongoing as the seasons roll on and your garden matures and flourishes.</p>
