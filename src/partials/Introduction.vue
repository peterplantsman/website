                    I believe that it is plants that make a garden, and a great garden is made by combining the
                    right plants in the right way to create a harmonious whole.
                </p>
                <p class="my-4">
                    This takes knowledge & skill, and the experience of having worked with plants over a long period
                    of time – it takes a plantsman.

                <p class="my-4">
                    A garden design may incorporate features other than plants of course – decking, ponds, paths
                    and so on, but these are the domain of the builder.

                    A plantsman is not a builder, nor a builder a plantsman.

                <p class="my-4">
                    A complete garden scheme will combine the hard landscaping skills of the builder with the soft
                    landscaping skills of the plantsman.
