                    I will happily make an after-care visit once the new planting has been in place for a few weeks
                    to check all is well and answer any questions you may have. The ongoing success of your new garden
                    will rely on your care, and I can advise you on what each plant needs to achieve its full potential.

                <p class="mt-4">
                    Depending on the size of your garden and the amount of time you yourself wish to spend on it, you
                    may wish to engage a gardener to help you. I will happily recommend local gardeners if you wish.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4">
                    If any plant fails due to a health problem it had before planting but which manifests itself only
                    later, I will of course happily replace it free of charge. After that I am always available by email
                    and will happily advise you ongoing as the seasons roll on and your garden matures and flourishes.
