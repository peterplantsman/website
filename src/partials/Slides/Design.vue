                    Step Three: Creating a Unique Design

                    My approach is to consider all of requirements as identified using my unique questionnaire, and to
                    create a design and planting scheme that accommodates these. The design will also reflect the budget
                    you have set, and your views on how much time you wish to spend gardening in the future.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4">
                    I hand-draw and colour every design myself, and itâ€™s yours to keep whether you decide to actually
                    realise the design or not. The design will incorporate any hard landscaping features you have
                    requested, as well as a full, illustrated list of all the plants proposed.
