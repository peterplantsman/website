                    I can measure your garden and create an accurate scale drawing, showing all of the key features as
                    they exist currently. This is the base plan upon which I would create a new design.

                    For some, this base plan is all they want as it gives them the basics on which they can sketch
                    their own designs â€“ and have great fun doing it!
