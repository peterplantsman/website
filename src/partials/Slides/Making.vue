                <p>
                    It will probably be necessary to remove at least some trees, shrubs, plants and hard landscaping
                    features from your existing garden, and to dig over and improve the soil prior to re-planting.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4">
                    You can do this yourself of course (though it can be a lot of hard work!) or get a gardening
                    contractor to do this for you. I am happy to oversee this stage for you if you wish by a series of
                    site visits and meetings with the contractor, or you can manage the contractor yourself.
                </p>
                <p class="font-bold underline my-2">Building Work</p>
                <p class="mt-4">
                    Any hard landscaping elements you have asked for as part of your new design will require a competent
                    builder (unless you are one yourself!). Again, I am happy to oversee this stage for you if you wish
                    by a series of site visits and meetings with the contractor, or you can manage this element yourself too.
                </p>
                <p class="font-bold underline my-2">Sourcing the Plants</p>
                <p class="mt-4">
                    I use a number of excellent wholesale suppliers to source plants for the gardens I design, and will
                    happily manage this for you. I charge a commission on the plant costs, but even including this I
                    will usually be able to source plants at well below normal garden centre prices. You can of course
                    choose to source your own plants if you prefer.
                </p>
                <p class="font-bold underline my-2">Planting Out</p>
                <p class="mt-4">
                    Although you could do this part yourself, I recommend that you involve me in this work as the long-term
                    success of any plant relies heavily on correct planting. With that being said, I encourage people to get their
                    hands dirty and help out with the planting – it makes the end result feel much more your own creation,
                    it’s very satisfying, and it will save you money.
